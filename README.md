# My Blog

This is where I'll put my blog entries, articles and pieces.
In here I will share my experiences as a video game developper.

The opinions presented here are my own and do not reflect my employer's.

I'm aware this is an untraditionnal format, I chose it for a few reasons:

- I'm comfortable in Github, it's a great platform
- Files are easy to edit and insert styles, images or code inserts
- It's free
- No ads
- I can invite collaborators or accept correction requests

I'm not getting stats on the number of views and I don't have a comment section per say, but this I don't mind.
