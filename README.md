# My Blog

This is where I'll put my blog entries, articles and pieces.
In here I will share my experiences as a video game developper.

The opinions presented here are my own and do not reflect my employer's.

*PS:*
I'm aware this is an untraditionnal format, I'm not expecting much from this - and we all know what comment sections end up like.
I might migrate these posts to a more traditionnal blog site at some point.
