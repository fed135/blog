# Job rationalization

**January 27th 2016**

## The balance system

Everytime I get a new job, I create this little text file, listing the pros of my new position. The stuff that mades me happy about the place, like friendly collegues, an interesting project or the quality of their [coffee](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-one-office-perk-you-must-splurge-on-2011-3). And I would also list the cons, the stuff that I don't like or that doesn't quite match my expectations. Things like less-than-average conditions, bad management or boring projects. 

I update this file regularily as I discover new aspects of the job or changes in my desires and ambitions. I find that there are good periods where I write more pros, and darker periods, where I slam a couple of cons to the list. After some time, I can get a clear picture of my current level of enjoyment, fullfilment and the trending direction of this level.

I find it healthy to have a clear image of where I stand towards my place of work, in a very rationnal way. Sometimes we don't want to admit the way we feel about our situation. We might feel depressed, underwhelmed, fatigued or downright angry. We stick around in dead-end jobs because we feel that it might lead to something better at some point, because we don't want to disapoint, because we are affraid to take a leap. Having this system allows us to put reasons and arguments in our favor. Points to argue with your boss. `"I want a raise"`. `"I want to work on a different project."`

There is also the other side of it: being too greedy. I'm a very demanding person. I expect the best out of people, and of myself. Therefore, when things weren't going according to my expectations, I bailed out. My -**fabulous**- fianc√©e, which I have known for 3+ years has made note of this, reminding me that I have had 3 different employers in our time together. 

I don't regret making the moves. These jobs made me into a better programmer, allowing me to experience different working environemnts, to discover different technologies and to hone my skills alongside industry-renowned mentors. I didn't feel shame or that I owed to "make it work" with past employers - which I think is what this industry is sort of promoting; [serial job hopping](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/15/job-hopping-can-boost-your-career-if-you-do-it-right.html). 

Trained professionnals are hard to come by, and the demand is very high. This makes for compagnies putting extra effort into the recruting of talent. It gave birth to sky-high [salaries](http://www.worldsalaries.org/computerprogrammer.shtml) and bonuses, dedicated talent agencies specializing in IT needs, huge referal bonuses, stock options on hire and other crazy sugar coating. All of this contributing to one of the most ridiculous [turnover rate](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/tech-companies-have-highest-turnover-rate/) reccorded to date.

...but what about retention? How do you keep people motivated once they realized that they've traded their happiness for a six-digit salary.

## After leaving a job

After quitting a job, I would always find myself angrily talking to my friends about all the bad from that job, even the stuff that wasn't related to my reasons for leaving. I guess it's true when they say that bad memories are the ones you remember most. That is how we learn from our mistakes. But I would often forget about the good. It would only come months later, once I'm already seept into a comfortable new office, with new people and different challenges. Without warning, I get this thought. What is this new place missing that I liked in my old job? 

And then you start thinking back on why you left your previous job. Did I give it my best? Did my ex-collegues enjoy working with me? Did the fact of listing all the cons about my current job affected the way I see it - has it had an impact on my performance? And the worst, Am I where I should be - am I the problem? - *ouch*

When I get to that last question, I need to sit for a moment. Take a couple of deep breaths and try look back on the reasons why I became a programmer. I try to recall all the good times that I had in school, the good jobs, the open-source projects I'm working on, the great people I met.

For me, it's never been a question. It's what I love to do, it's my passion. But after a bad experience or two in some workplaces, you start to doubt. Maybe it wasn't a coincidence. Maybe the whole industry is like that and I'm just not fit for it.

After that period of thinking, I would often come to great realizations about myself. I even wrote a letter to one of my old bosses in an attempt to dissarm any hard feelings could be still present, but also because I really miss that job.

## What now

I still think that the pro and con sheet is a good tool, but there is one step that I was missing: sharing it with my bosses. Letting them in on the stuff that pisses me off, or things that I want - while not forgetting the reasons why I love the job - seems to me like the best course of action.

How else can I make my workplace my own than by sharing my expectations and my feelings about it.



This blog helps too, I think I'll keep doing that.
