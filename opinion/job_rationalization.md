**January 27th 2016**

## The balance system

Everytime I get a new job, I create this little text file, listing the pros of my new position. The stuff that mades me happy about the place, like friendly colleagues, an interesting project or the quality of their [coffee](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-one-office-perk-you-must-splurge-on-2011-3). And I also list the cons, the stuff that I don't like or that doesn't quite match my expectations. Things like less-than-average conditions, bad management or boring projects.

I update this file regularly as I discover new aspects of the job or changes in my desires and ambitions. I find that there are good periods where I write more pros, and darker periods, where I slam a couple of cons to the list. After some time, I get a clear picture of my current level of enjoyment, fulfillment and the trending direction of this level.

I find it healthy to have a clear image of where I stand towards my place of work, in a very rational way. Sometimes we don't want to admit the way we feel about our situation. We might feel depressed, underwhelmed, fatigued or downright angry. We stick around in dead-end jobs because we feel that it might lead to something better at some point, or because we don't want to disappoint the people around us, or because we are afraid to take a leap of faith. Having this system allows us to put reasons and arguments in our favor. Real words to put in your discussions with your boss. `"I want a raise"`. `"I want to work on a different project."`

There is also the other side of it: being too greedy. I'm a very demanding person. I expect the best out of people, and of myself. Therefore, when things aren't going according to my expectations, I often find myself bailing out. My -**fabulous**- fiancée, which I have known for 3+ years has made note of this, reminding me that I have had 3 different employers in our time together.

I don't regret making the moves. These jobs made me into a better programmer, allowing me to experience different working environments, to discover different technologies and to hone my skills alongside industry-renowned mentors. I didn't feel shame or that I owed to "make it work" with past employers - which I think is what this industry is sort of promoting; [serial job hopping](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/15/job-hopping-can-boost-your-career-if-you-do-it-right.html).

Trained professionals are hard to come by, and the demand is very high. Tech companies are putting extra efforts into the recruiting of talent. It gave birth to sky-high [salaries](http://www.worldsalaries.org/computerprogrammer.shtml) and bonuses, dedicated talent agencies specializing in IT needs, huge referal bonuses, stock options on hire and other crazy sugar coating. All of this contributing to one of the most ridiculous [turnover rate](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/tech-companies-have-highest-turnover-rate/) reccorded to date.

...but what about retention? How do you keep people motivated once they realized that they've traded their happiness for a six-digit salary.

## After leaving a job

After quitting a job, I often find myself angrily talking to my friends about all the stuff I hated during my time at that job, even the stuff that wasn't related to my reasons for leaving. I guess it's true when they say that bad memories are the ones you remember most. That is how we learn from our mistakes. But I would often forget about the good. It’s only months later, once I'm already seeped into a comfortable new office, with new people and different challenges that, without warning, I get this thought. What is this new place missing that I liked in my old job?

And then you start thinking back on why you left your previous job. Did I give it my best? Did my ex-colleagues enjoy working with me? Did the fact of listing all the cons about my job affected the way I see it - has it had an impact on my performance? And the worst, Am I where I should be - am I the problem? - *ouch*

When I get to that last question, I need to sit for a moment. Take a couple of deep breaths and try look back on the reasons why I became a programmer. I try to recall all the good times that I had in school, the good jobs, the open-source projects I'm working on, the [global game jams](http://globalgamejam.org/), and of course the great people I met.

For me, it's never been a question. It's what I love to do, it's my passion. But after a bad experience or two in some workplaces, you start to doubt. Maybe it wasn't a coincidence. Maybe the whole industry is like that and I'm just not fit for it.

After that period of thinking, I would often come to great realizations about myself. I even wrote a letter to one of my old bosses in an attempt to disarm any hard feelings that could be still present, but also because I really missed that job.

## What now

I still think that the pro and con sheet is a good tool, but there is one step that I was missing: sharing it with my bosses. Letting them in on the stuff that pisses me off, or things that I want - while not forgetting the reasons why I love the job - seems to me like the best course of action.

How else can I make my workplace my own than by sharing my expectations and my feelings about it.



This blog helps too, I think I'll keep doing that.
